# CHANGELOGS

## v4.1.0 — 2026-08-20

### ⚡ Improvements

- Session replay now adapts to 120 Hz (ProMotion) displays, cutting replay CPU usage roughly in half on those devices while keeping the app fluid.
- Replays no longer start with a blank lead-in — recording begins from the first captured frame.

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Video, map, and GPU content on Android is now correctly covered by masking and anonymized replay settings.
- Fixed a replay issue where a masked field hidden by a newer screen could leave a gray block on screen.
- Fixed recordings freezing or showing stale content when the app was backgrounded or the device was rotated mid-recording.

## Version 4.0.4 [2026-08-13]

**Bug fixes 🐛**

- Respondents can attach a picture to an answer again on iOS: the attach button opened nothing, and the photo library could end up behind the survey (iOS).
- An audio answer no longer asks for the camera, and refusing one permission no longer takes the whole answer down (Android).
- Recording works on the first attempt instead of failing until the respondent tried again (Android).
